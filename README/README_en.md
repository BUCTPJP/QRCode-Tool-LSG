# QRCode-Tool-LSG
We have integrated and updated the original code for generating and parsing QR codes, deleted the old warehouse, and moved it here uniformly
***
## Language：
+ Chinese Simplified|[zh](https://github.com/BUCTPJP/QRCode-Tool-LSG/blob/master/README/README_zh.md)
+ English|[en](https://github.com/BUCTPJP/QRCode-Tool-LSG/blob/master/README/README_en.md)
## Function：
### 1.Generate QR code
+ Directly generate regular style QR codes
+ Generate QR code with logo
+ Generate QR codes with background images
### 2.Parsing QR codes
## Instructions for use：
When generating QR codes with background images, try not to choose images with overly complex backgrounds
When generating a QR code with a background image, try to have a significant difference between the color of the QR code and the main color of the background as much as possible
3. QR codes with background images may not be recognized by this software in some cases, but applications such as WeChat can
4. If you still cannot recognize the QR code with a background image, you can use advanced settings (input boxes in the software that prompt careless use)
This option defaults to 8, which can be increased appropriately to obtain a more easily recognizable QR code. It is recommended to gradually increase the value. If the value is too large, it will cause the generation time to be too long and the GUI will get stuck
5. Choose a square as much as possible for the background image or logo image, otherwise there may be incomplete or distorted image display

### 2.Parsing QR codes
## Instructions for use：
+ 1.When generating QR codes with background images, ``try not to choose images with overly complex backgrounds``
+ 2.When generating a QR code with a background image, try to have a ``significant difference`` between the color of the QR code and the main color of the background as much as possible
+ 3.QR codes with background images may not be recognized by this software in some cases, but applications such as WeChat can
+ 4.If you still cannot recognize the QR code with a background image, you can use advanced settings (input boxes in the software that prompt careless use)<br>

+ 5.Choose a ``square`` as much as possible for the ``background image`` or ``logo image``, otherwise there may be incomplete or distorted image display
+ 6.The QR codes of ``some colors cannot be recognized`` by either this tool or WeChat, and the reason is unknown
